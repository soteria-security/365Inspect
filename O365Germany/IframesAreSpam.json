It is advisable to create content filter rules to detect iframes in email as spam.",
    "Remediation": "Navigate to the Exchange Admin Center's 'Protection' menu, then click the 'spam filter' section. Create a spam policy or modify the default spam policy such that it is activated when iframes are found in emails.

These settings may soon be replaced by the Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in Exchange Online Protection. Refer to the references below for additional information.",
