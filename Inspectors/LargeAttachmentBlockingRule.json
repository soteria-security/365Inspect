	"FindingName": "No Transport Rules to Block Large Attachments",
	"Description": "No Exchange Online Transport Rules are in place to block emails with overly large attachments. Emails with overly large attachments may present a security risk for several reasons. Emails the domains receive may have overly large attachments that contain malware, and adversaries sometimes use overly large files in an attempt to bypass anti-malware scanners or otherwise avoid suspicion. An adversary with access to an organizational email account may also use a large attachment to exfiltrate sensitive data from the organization; for example, emailing an encrypted archive file to other adversarial infrastructure using a compromised O365 account. It is often recommended to create a rule that detects and blocks attachments over a certain size for these reasons.",
