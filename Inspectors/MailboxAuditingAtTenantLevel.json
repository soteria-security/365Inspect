	"FindingName": "Mailbox Auditing Should be Enabled at Tenant Level",
	"Description": "Mailbox Auditing is an Exchange mailbox feature that, when activated, generates audit logs for events related to a user's use of email. This is one of the most oft-recommended security improvements to Exchange because mailbox audit logs can contain information critical in a detection or response scenario such as triaging a business email compromise. Mailbox auditing can be globally enabled at the tenant level, which supersedes all per-mailbox settings, but it is not currently enabled.",
	"Remediation": "Mailbox auditing can be globally enabled within the Tenant using the Set-OrganizationConfig commandlet as follows: Set-OrganizationConfig -AuditDisabled $false.",
	"DefaultValue" : "False",
    "ExpectedValue" : "False",
