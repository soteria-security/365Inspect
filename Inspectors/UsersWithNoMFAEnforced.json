	"FindingName": "Users with No Multi-Factor Authentication Enforced",
	"Description": "The O365 user accounts listed above do not have multi-factor authentication enforced by an administrator. Multi-factor authentication is an essential security setting that can prevent an adversary from compromising a user account even if the adversary has their password. Multi-factor authentication is an additional obstacle to adversaries who obtain user credentials through phishing or other means. Note that this module relies on reading settings configured within Microsoft Online/Azure AD and may not account for Conditional Access Policies or the use of third-party MFA solutions.",
	"Remediation": "There are multiple different ways to roll out MFA and several considerations to take into account before rolling out MFA to the organization. Multi-factor authentication rollout can require significant effort. Follow the detailed O365 MFA guide described below.",
