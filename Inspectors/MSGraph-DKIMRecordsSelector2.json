	"Description": "Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) Selector2 records are not published for the domains identified. DKIM is a technology that uses public-key cryptography as a tool to help assure the integrity of emails as they are sent between servers. Additionally, cyber adversaries are known to sometimes generate spoofed (falsified) emails which appear to originate from the organization. DKIM can also enable recipients to distinguish spoofed email from authentic email originating from the domain, therefore increasing trust in the domain and ideally reducing the likelihood that members of the organization or related organizations will be successfully phished by imitative attacks. The domains listed above do not have DKIM Selector 2 DNS records, which are one of the two vital records for implementing DKIM for O365.",
	"Remediation": "Follow the guide in the References section to learn the full significance of the DKIM Selector2 record to O365 DKIM configuration. DKIM rollout can be a very involved process, for which there is a complete reference in the 'Use DKIM to validate the outbound email sent from your custom domain' guide in the References section below. This finding refers specifically to enabling the DKIM signing configuration within O365 itself, which can be done using the Set-DkimSigningConfig PowerShell function or the Security and Compliance Center in the O365 administration portal.",
