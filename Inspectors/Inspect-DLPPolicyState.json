	"FindingName": "DLP Policies Not Enabled and Enforced",
	"Description": "Policies were found in a state other than 'Enable'. The state of the policy determines what, if any, actions are taken when the policy is triggered. Reasons that a policy may be in a state other than 'Enable' include testing, policy deprecation, and auditing as well as potentially nefarious reasons. Policy state definitions are: \n- Enable: The policy is enabled for actions and notifications. This is the default value.\n- Disable: The policy is disabled.\n- TestWithNotifications: No actions are taken, but notifications are sent.\n- TestWithoutNotifications: An audit mode where no actions are taken, and no notifications are sent.",
	"Remediation": "Validate that the current state of the policies returned are expected and remediate as necessary.",
