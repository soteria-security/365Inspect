	"FindingName": "Malware Filter Policies Don't Alert for Internal Users Sending Malware",
	"Description": "Malware being sent by an internal user's email account is often an indication that a security event has occurred. For this reason it is strongly recommended that each organization have malware filter policies that alert administrators when malware is being sent by an internal user's account. It is possible to configure malware filter policies in O365 that generate these alerts. The malware filter policies listed herein do not alert an administrator when an internal user sends malware.",
	"Remediation": "It is possible to configure malware filter policies from within the Exchange Online Protection portal or through the Set-MalwareFilterPolicy command as follows: 'Set-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity 'Malware Filter Policy Name' -Action DeleteMessage -EnableInternalSenderAdminNotifications $true -InternalSenderAdminAddress admin@yourdomain.com'. Make sure you set the policy to email a service account or administrator that is active and monitored, and consider establishing a retention period for which to store malware alerts, as they may be evidence in future security incidents.",
