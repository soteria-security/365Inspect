	"FindingName": "Microsoft Teams Users Allowed to Invite Anonymous Users",
	"Description": "Microsoft Teams by default enables and allows anonymous users to join Teams meetings. This finding returns the users within the tenant that have the ability to invite anonymous users into the Teams environment. Some organizations may wish to disable this functionality, or restrict certain users, members, or roles from allowing anonymous users to join meetings. Changing these settings may have unintended consequences. Speak with shareholders and understand what functionality may be affected before disabling this access.",
	"Remediation": "This can be mitigated by navigating to the Teams admin center and turning off 'Anonymous users can join a meeting' under Meeting settings. This disables anonymous access globally. Alternatively, specific users and groups can be targeted by creating a new Meeting Policy and issuing this command in PowerShell: Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity 'Policy Name' -AllowAnonymousUsersToJoinMeeting $false",
	"DefaultValue" : "All users assigned to default Teams Meeting Policies",
