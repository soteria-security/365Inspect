	"Remediation": "Educate users about mandatory MFA and its purpose. Consider using an MFA enrollment option that requires users to configure at least one MFA method upon their next login. Continue to monitor the status of MFA via 365Inspect, direct PowerShell commands, the Office 365 administration portal, or other appropriate tooling to assess whether users configure MFA over time.",
