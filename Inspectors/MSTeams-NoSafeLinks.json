	"FindingName": "Safe Links for Teams is Not Enabled",
	"ProductFamily": "Microsoft Teams",
	"CVS": "9.6",
	"Description": "Safe Links is a feature of O365 that enables real-time detection of malicious links in incoming Exchange emails and other Office 365 applications. The Safe Links feature can also be enabled for links shared via Microsoft Teams. However, this setting is disabled in the 365 instance. Enabling it can decrease the risk of phishing and other attacks that might utilize malicious links sent via Teams, although it is not a panacea for these attacks.",
	"Remediation": "Perhaps the most convenient way to enable this feature is to use the Set-SafeLinksPolicy command in PowerShell as such: Set-SafeLinksPolicy -IsEnabled $true -EnableSafeLinksForTeams $true. Note that some organizations may have chosen to disable Safe Links for Teams if it interferes with day-to-day operations, so key stakeholders should be surveyed before enabling Safe Links for Teams.",
