	"FindingName": "DKIM Not Enabled for Exchange Online Domains",
	"Description": "DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is not enabled within O365 for the Exchange Online domains listed above. DKIM is a technology that uses public-key cryptography as a tool to help assure the integrity of emails as they are sent between servers. Additionally, cyber adversaries are known to sometimes generate spoofed (falsified) emails that appear to originate from your organization's domains. DKIM can also enable recipients to distinguish spoofed email from authentic email originating from your domain, therefore increasing trust in the domain and ideally reducing the likelihood that members of your own organization or related organizations will be successfully phished by imitative attacks. Depending on your organization's strategy for sender verification and other email security topics, you may wish to enable DKIM for your O365 domains.",
	"Remediation": "DKIM rollout can be a very involved process, for which there is a complete reference in the 'Use DKIM to validate the outbound email sent from your custom domain' guide in the References section below. This finding refers specifically to enabling the DKIM signing configuration within O365 itself, which can be done using the Set-DkimSigningConfig PowerShell function or the Security and Compliance Center in the O365 administration portal.",
