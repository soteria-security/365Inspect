	"Description": "Third-party integrated applications are allowed to run in the organization's Office 365 environment if a user authorizes them to do so. This configuration is considered insecure because a user may grant permissions to a malicious application without fully understanding the security implications. A user who installs a malicious third-party application is in effect compromised. Additionally, there are documented cases of a malicious actor gaining access to sensitive information by enticing a user to allow a third-party integrated application to run within their O365 Tenant.",
