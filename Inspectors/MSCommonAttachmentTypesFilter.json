	"FindingName": "Common Malicious Attachment Extensions are Not Filtered",
	"Description": "O365 includes a list of common malicious file attachment extensions that should be blocked/filtered from O365 emails. The file extensions listed herein are on this list of common malicious file extensions, but no O365 Malware Filter Policy is configured to filter them. Enabling common malicious attachment filtering may decrease the risk of malware spreading within the organization through phishing or lateral phishing. The common malicious attachments defined in O365 at the time this document was authored are: ace, ani, app, docm, exe, jar, reg, scr, vbe, vbs.",
	"Remediation": "This feature is accessible in the Security portal of the O365 Admin Center. Click through to Threat management → Policy → Anti-malware and toggle the Common Attachment Types Filter to 'On'. Additionally, other known dangerous attachment types may be quickly filtered by adding them to this policy's list, although creating a new policy to do this would be a more ideal long-term solution. Before doing this, consider polling key stakeholders in the organization or using available data to determine whether any of these file types are commonly exchanged via email within the organization.",
