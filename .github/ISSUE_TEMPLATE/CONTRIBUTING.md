## Use a Consistent Coding Style
365*Inspect* is written using VS Code. This keeps spacing conventions and alias use (or lack thereof) consistent across all of the included scripts.
Developing new inspectors and features within VS Code is encouraged, but not required.
In the war of "Tabs vs Spaces", we fall squarely into the "spaces" camp and request that spacing and tabbing be set to four spaces for consistency.
Spaces are consistently a single column regardless of environment, where tab columns can vary.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add your new code, changes, or bug fixes.
3. Submit your pull request.


## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances.
* The use of previously common terminology - "whitelist", "blacklist", "master", "slave". 
We ask that these be replaced with Allow/Block list, and Primary/Secondary or Parent/Child 
except in certain instances when it is necessary to retain such verbiage (eg, direct quotes, when contained in an article title or link, etc...)
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission (doxing)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [365Inspect-public@soteria.io](mailto:365Inspect-public@soteria.io?subject=[365Inspect%20Enforcement]%20Report). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
