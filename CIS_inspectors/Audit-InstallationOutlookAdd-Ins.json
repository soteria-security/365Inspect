	"FindingName": "[VULNERABLE] - Users can Install Outlook Add-ins",
	"Description": "Attackers commonly use vulnerable and custom-built add-ins to access data in user applications. While allowing users to install add-ins by themselves does allow them to easily acquire useful add-ins that integrate with Microsoft applications, it can represent a risk if not used and monitored carefully. Disable future user's ability to install add-ins in Microsoft Outlook helps reduce your threat-surface and mitigate this risk.",
	"Remediation": "1. Select Admin Centers and Exchange. > 2. Click on the Classic Exchange admin center at the bottom. > 3. Select permissions from the Exchange navigation panel. > 4.
