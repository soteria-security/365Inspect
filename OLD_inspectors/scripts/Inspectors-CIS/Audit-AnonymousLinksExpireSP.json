	"FindingName": "[VULNERABLE] - AnonymousLinks As Not Set To Expire!",
	"Description": "An attacker can compromise a user account for a short period of time, send anonymous sharing links to an external account, then take their time accessing the data. They can also compromise external accounts and steal the anonymous sharing links sent to those external entities well after the data has been shared. Restricting how long the links are valid can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.",
