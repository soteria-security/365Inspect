    "FindingName": "Applications Registered to Tenant with Certificate Credentials",
    "Description": "Registered applications within the Tenant can grant excessive OAuth permissions to the associated application and in turn grants those permissions to whomever is controlling the application. Registered Applications that leverage certificate credentials generally bypass MFA and Conditional Access Policies, and may allow attackers to authenticate as the application and perform any actions the application is capable of executing without triggering alerts. With sufficient access and privileges attackers may obtain or add credentials to existing applications in the environment.",
    "Remediation": "Remove unapproved applications and review OAuth permission grants. Soteria recommends Organizations to audit application and service principal credentials regularly to ensure all credentials are valid and expected. Tenants licensed for Advanced Hunting (see Licensing Requirements in the reference links below) may use the KQL query linked in the references below to query for events and create a custom detection rule based on the query.",
